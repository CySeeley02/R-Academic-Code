The combine command 	c( ) <br>
Descriptive statistics 	mean( ) sum( ) max( ) <br>
Arithmetic operators		+ - * /<br>
Boolean operators		>    <    >=    <=   ==   !=  <br>

**This Week:** Explore the **quakes** dataset (which is included in R). Copy the **quakes** dataset into a new dataframe (call it **myQuakes**), so that if you need to start over, you can do so easily (by copying quakes into myQuakes again). Summarize the variables in **myQuakes**. Also explore the structure of the dataframe

myquakes <- quakes

```{r}

```

**Step 1:** Explore the earthquake magnitude variable called **mag**  <br>

A.	What is the average magnitude? Use mean() or summary():
mean(myquakes$mag)
#4.6204 is the mean

```{r}

```

B.	What is the magnitude of the largest earthquake? Use max() or summary() and save the result in a variable called **maxQuake**:

maxquake <- max(myquakes$mag)
#6.4 is the maximum

```{r}

```

C.	What is the magnitude of the smallest earthquake? Use min() or summary() and save the result in a variable called **minQuake**:

minquake <- min(myquakes$mag)
#4 is the minimum

```{r}

```

D.	Output the **third row** of the dataframe

myquakes[3,]


```{r}

```

E. Create a new dataframe, with only the rows where the **magnitude is greater than 4**. How many rows are in that dataframe (use code, do not count by looking at the output) 

bigquakes <- subset(myquakes, mag > 4)
nrow(bigquakes)
#there are 4 rows in bigquakes

```{r}

```

F.	Create a **sorted dataframe** based on magnitude and store it in **quakeSorted1**. Do the sort two different ways, once with arrange() and then with order()

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
quakesorted1 <- arrange(myquakes, myquakes$mag)
quakesorted2 <- myquakes[order(myquakes$mag),]


```{r}

```

G.	What are the latitude and longitude of the quake reported by the largest number of stations?  

latlon <- myquakes[order(myquakes$stations),]
latlon[1000,]
#the latitude was -12.23 and the longitude was 167.02


```{r}

```

H.	What are the latitude and longitude of the quake reported by the smallest number of stations?  

latlon[1,]
#the latitude was -21 and the longitude was 181.66 although there was multiple minimums for stations

```{r}

```

**Step 3:** Using conditional if statements <br>

I.	 Test if **maxQuake** is greater than 7 (output “yes” or “no”) <br>
**Hint:** Try modifying the following code in R: 

if (maxquake > 7) "Yes" else "no"

```{r}
if  (100 < 150) "100 is less than 150" else "100 is greater than 150"
```

J.	 Following the same logic, test if **minQuake** is less than 3 (output “yes” or “no”):

if (minquake < 3) "yes" else "no"

```{r}

```
